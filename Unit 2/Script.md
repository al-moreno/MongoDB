## Introduction


MongoDB is a document-oriented database, it is often referred to as a non-relational database which means that it is a non-tabular database. Simply stated, the data is not stored in a table format. Rather, MongoDB stores data in flexible documents which allows us to search and read data faster than tabular databases such as SQL. The documents used to store data are called collections.


As I just stated, MongoDB is a document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON. It can be installed locally or hosted in the cloud.

A record in MongoDB is a document, a data structure composed of key-value pairs where the field values may include strings, Booleans, numbers, arrays, or nested documents.

Example:
{
title: “Instructor”,
name: “Ana Moreno”,
organization: “Craft Knowledge”,
likes: 15,
subjects: [“HTML”, “CSS”, “MySQL”],
date: DATE()
}

In the next few sections, we will be learning about CRUD.
