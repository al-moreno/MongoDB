- Slide 3 - 

To manage MongoDB services on macOS, you can use the following commands:

To start the MongoDB service, open the terminal and run the command: `brew services start mongodb-community@4.4`. This will initiate the MongoDB service and make it available for use.

If you need to stop the MongoDB service, execute the command: `brew services stop mongodb-community@4.4`. This will gracefully stop the MongoDB service and terminate its processes.

To restart the MongoDB service, simply run the command: `brew services restart mongodb-community@4.4`. This will stop and then start the MongoDB service, ensuring a fresh instance is running.

To view a list of all MongoDB services managed by Homebrew, use the command: `brew services list`. This will provide you with information about the running status of the MongoDB service.

Please note that the provided commands assume you have MongoDB installed using Homebrew and that the MongoDB service is managed by Homebrew services. Adjust the version number in the commands to match your installed MongoDB version if it differs from 4.4.


- Slide 4 - 

To manage MongoDB services on Windows, you can use the following commands in the Command Prompt with administrative privileges:

To start the MongoDB service, run the command "net start MongoDB". For stopping the MongoDB service, use "net stop MongoDB". If you want to restart the MongoDB service, you can enter "net stop MongoDB && net start MongoDB". To list the MongoDB services and obtain service information, execute the command "sc query MongoDB".

Please note that these commands assume MongoDB is installed as a Windows service. Adjust the command if your MongoDB service has a different name or if you have multiple MongoDB services installed. Ensure you run the Command Prompt as an administrator to have the necessary privileges for managing the MongoDB services.

Additionally, considering data modeling techniques can lead to efficient and maintainable database schemas, facilitating easier data retrieval and manipulation. Monitoring database performance and usage is crucial for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing resource utilization, ensuring optimal performance and scalability. By adhering to these practices, you can effectively manage your MongoDB databases and ensure the reliability, security, and efficiency of your MongoDB deployments.








## Running MongoDB service for macOS and Windows

Here are the instructions for starting and stopping the MongoDB service on both macOS and Windows operating systems:

####  Service on macOS:
To start, stop, restart, and list MongoDB services on macOS, you can use the following commands:

1. Start MongoDB service:
   ```
   brew services start mongodb-community@4.4
   ```

2. Stop MongoDB service:
   ```
   brew services stop mongodb-community@4.4
   ```

3. Restart MongoDB service:
   ```
   brew services restart mongodb-community@4.4
   ```

4. List MongoDB services:
   ```
   brew services list
   ```

The above commands assume that you have MongoDB installed using Homebrew and the MongoDB service is managed by Homebrew services. The version specified in the commands is 4.4, but you can replace it with your installed MongoDB version if different.


#### Service on Windows:
To start, stop, restart, and list MongoDB services on Windows, you can use the following commands:

1. Start MongoDB service:
   Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and run the command:
   ```
   net start MongoDB
   ```

2. Stop MongoDB service:
   Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and execute the command:
   ```
   net stop MongoDB
   ```

3. Restart MongoDB service:
   Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and enter the command:
   ```
   net stop MongoDB && net start MongoDB
   ```

4. List MongoDB services:
   Open the Command Prompt as an administrator and use the command:
   ```
   sc query MongoDB
   ```

These commands assume that you have MongoDB installed as a Windows service. The "net start" command starts the MongoDB service, "net stop" stops the MongoDB service, and "sc query" lists the MongoDB service information.

Please note that you might need to adjust the command if your MongoDB service has a different name or if you have multiple MongoDB services installed.
