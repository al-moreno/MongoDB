## Introduction

MongoDB is a document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database program MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON. It can be installed locally or hosted in the cloud.


A record in MongoDB is refered to as a document, which is a data structure composed of key value pairs where the field values may include strings, booleans, numbers, arrays or nested documents.

Example: 
{
	title: “Instructor”,
	name: “Ana Moreno”,
	organization: “Craft Knowledge”,
	likes: 15,
	subjects: [“HTML”, “CSS”, “MySQL”],
	date: DATE()
}





## Getting Started

Previously, we stated that MondoDB is a document-oriented database, it is offten refered to as a non-relational database which means really means that it is a non-tabular database which simply means that the data is not stored in a table format. Rather, MangoDB stores data in flexible documents which allows us to search and read data faster that tabular databases such as SQL. The documents used to store data are called collections.


Understanding that MongoDB is a document-oriented database, we will know breiefly discuss the local vs cloud hosting options. MongoDB can be installed loccally, which will allow you to host your own MongoDB server allowing oyou to become familiar with how to manager, upgrade and maintain a server however, for this course, we will be using the Cloud based platform of MongoDB Atlas which is much easier to manage. Begin by signing up with an account at the following [MongoDB Atlas services](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_campaign=w3schools_mdb&utm_source=w3schools&utm_medium=referral)
