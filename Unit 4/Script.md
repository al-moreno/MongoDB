- Slide 3 - 


The process of inserting new documents into collections involves utilizing the `insertOne()` and `insertMany()` methods, which offer flexibility depending on the number of documents to be inserted. 

To insert a single document, you can use the `insertOne()` method. This method takes a single document as an argument and adds it to the specified collection. For example,`db.collectionName.insertOne({ field1: value1, field2: value2, ... });`. 

On the other hand, when you need to insert multiple documents simultaneously, you can employ the `insertMany()` method. This method takes an array of documents as the parameter, and each document is inserted into the specified collection. For example, `db.collectionName.insertMany([{ field1: value1, field2: value2 }, { field1: value3, field2: value4 }, ... ]);`. 

Both `insertOne()` and `insertMany()` methods return information about the inserted documents, including the _id field, which is automatically generated by MongoDB to provide a unique identifier for each document. By utilizing these methods, you can seamlessly insert new documents into MongoDB collections, ensuring efficient data storage and organization.


- Slide 4  - 


When it comes to MongoDB, the ability to query for documents using the find() method, the findOne() method and query operators provides the ability to filter and search for precise data.

In MongoDB, basic querying involves using the `find()` method. To retrieve all documents from a collection, you can simply call the `find()` method without any parameters. This will fetch all the documents present in the collection. However, if you require more specific results, you can pass a filter object as an argument to the `find()` method. The filter object consists of key-value pairs that define the fields and their corresponding values to match against. For instance, if you want to find documents where the "name" field has a value of "John", you can execute the query:`db.collectionName.find({ name: "John" })`. This will return all the documents that meet this specific condition.



- Slide 5 _


Comparison operators play a crucial role in querying based on specific conditions. MongoDB offers a range of useful comparison operators that allow for precise data retrieval. Some commonly utilized comparison operators include `$eq` for equality, `$ne` for not equals, `$gt` for greater than, `$lt` for less than, `$gte` for greater than or equals, and `$lte` for less than or equals. To illustrate, suppose you want to find documents where the "age" field exceeds 30. In this case, you can execute the following query: `db.collectionName.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })`. This query will return all the documents that satisfy the condition of having an "age" value greater than 30. By leveraging these comparison operators, MongoDB enables precise and flexible querying based on specific conditions.


- Slide 6 -

MongoDB also offers powerful logical operators that facilitate combining multiple conditions in a single query. These logical operators, including $and, $or, and $not, expand the querying capabilities by allowing for complex conditions. To illustrate, suppose you wish to find documents where the "age" field is greater than 30 and the "gender" field is "male". In such cases, you can employ the $and operator within the find() method. The query would look like this: db.collectionName.find({ $and: [{ age: { $gt: 30 } }, { gender: "male" }] }). This query will fetch all the documents that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. MongoDB's logical operators empower users to construct sophisticated queries by combining multiple conditions to retrieve the desired documents.

- Slide 7 -

Array operators offer valuable functionality for querying arrays within documents. These operators, such as $in, $nin, $all, $elemMatch, and others, enable precise querying and manipulation of array fields. For instance, suppose you want to find documents where the "tags" field contains either "mongodb" or "database". In this case, you can utilize the $in operator within the find() method. The query would be as follows: db.collectionName.find({ tags: { $in: ["mongodb", "database"] } }). This query will retrieve all the documents where the "tags" field includes either "mongodb" or "database". By employing array operators, MongoDB provides a versatile solution for querying and working with arrays in documents, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

- Slide 8 - 

Projections provide a way to control the fields that are returned in the query results. By default, the `find()` method returns all fields of the matched documents. However, you can tailor the output by specifying which fields to include or exclude using the second parameter of the `find()` method. For instance, if you want to retrieve only the "name" and "age" fields in the result, you can execute the following query: `db.collectionName.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })`. This query will include only the specified fields ("name" and "age") in the returned documents. The value of 1 indicates inclusion, while 0 would signify exclusion. Projections offer a flexible way to fine-tune the query output by selecting the necessary fields and reducing the amount of data transferred, optimizing efficiency in data retrieval.

By using these querying techniques and operators, you can effectively filter and search for specific data in MongoDB collections, retrieving the desired documents based on your criteria.

- Slide 9 -
In MongoDB, achieving sorted query results and limiting the number of returned documents is possible by utilizing the `sort()` and `limit()` methods. In the following sections, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to effectively implement these methods to accomplish the desired sorting and limiting outcomes.

In MongoDB, sorting query results is accomplished by utilizing the `sort()` method. Once you execute a query using the `find()` method, you can proceed to apply sorting by chaining the `sort()` method. The `sort()` method accepts a sorting criteria object, where each field represents a key, and its corresponding value determines the desired sorting order. Use `1` for ascending order and `-1` for descending order. For instance, to sort documents in ascending order based on the "age" field, you would use the following query: `db.collectionName.find().sort({ age: 1 })`. This query will return the documents in ascending order based on their "age" values. By incorporating the `sort()` method, MongoDB enables the precise ordering of query results, providing greater control and flexibility for data retrieval.

- Slide 10 

To restrict the number of returned documents in MongoDB, you can employ the `limit()` method. It is as simple as chaining the `limit()` method after the `find()` method. The `limit()` method requires a numeric value that signifies the maximum number of documents to be included in the result. For instance, if you wish to retrieve only the first five documents, you can execute the following query: `db.collectionName.find().limit(5)`. This query will limit the output to a maximum of five documents. By using the `limit()` method, you have the ability to control the number of documents returned, allowing for more precise and efficient data retrieval in MongoDB queries.

- Slide 11 - 

In MongoDB, it is possible to combine sorting and limiting operations to obtain a specific number of documents in a sorted order. By merging these operations, you can retrieve a subset of documents that meets both criteria. For instance, if you want to retrieve the five oldest documents based on the "age" field, you can utilize the `sort()` method to sort the documents in descending order based on "age" (-1), and then apply the `limit()` method to limit the output to five documents. This can be achieved with the following query: `db.collectionName.find().sort({ age: -1 }).limit(5)`. By combining sorting and limiting in MongoDB, you can efficiently retrieve a specific number of documents while ensuring they are presented in the desired sorted order.

By utilizing the `sort()` and `limit()` methods, you can effectively control the order and number of documents returned in your MongoDB queries. Sorting ensures the desired order of results based on specific fields, while limiting allows you to focus on a specific subset of documents for more efficient data retrieval.

- Slide 12 -


MongoDB provides powerful techniques for accessing and manipulating nested documents and arrays within MongoDB documents, offering flexibility and efficiency in working with complex data structures. Next, we'll look at some techniques to showcase their capabilities.

When working with nested documents in MongoDB, accessing specific fields within them can be achieved using dot notation. Dot notation involves specifying the path to the desired field by separating each nested level with a dot. For example, to access the "city" field within the "address" field of a document, you would use: `documentName.address.city`. This syntax allows you to directly access the nested field and retrieve its value. Additionally, dot notation can be chained to access fields within deeply nested documents. For instance, `documentName.address.location.coordinates` accesses the "coordinates" field within the "location" field, which is nested within the "address" field. By utilizing dot notation, you can effectively navigate and retrieve data from nested documents in MongoDB.


- Slide 13 -

In MongoDB, manipulating fields within nested documents involves using dot notation in combination with specific operators. To update fields, you can utilize dot notation along with the $set operator. For example, to update the "city" field within the "address" field of a specific document, you can execute the following query: db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $set: { "address.city": "New City" } }). This query updates the value of the "city" field to "New City" within the nested "address" field. Similarly, to delete fields within nested documents, you can use dot notation and the $unset operator. For instance, the query db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $unset: { "address.city": "" } }) removes the "city" field within the "address" field of a specific document. By leveraging dot notation and the appropriate operators, you can effectively manipulate fields within nested documents in MongoDB.

- Slide 14 -

In MongoDB, accessing and manipulating arrays involves utilizing array indexing and specific array operators. To access elements within an array, you can use the array index notation, where `documentName.arrayName[index]` retrieves the element at the specified index within the array. This allows you to retrieve specific elements based on their position within the array. MongoDB also provides a range of array operators such as `$push`, `$pop`, `$addToSet`, `$pull`, and more for efficient manipulation of array elements. These operators enable you to add new elements, remove existing ones, or modify array contents according to your requirements. By leveraging array indexing and the array operators provided by MongoDB, you gain flexibility in accessing and modifying array elements, enhancing the data manipulation capabilities within your MongoDB documents.


- Slide 15 -

In MongoDB, the combination of nested documents and arrays offers the capability to represent intricate data structures. MongoDB allows for the inclusion of nested documents within arrays and vice versa, providing flexibility in organizing and storing complex data. The techniques mentioned earlier, such as accessing fields within nested documents using dot notation and manipulating array elements using array operators, can be applied to navigate and modify nested documents within arrays as well as arrays within nested documents. This allows for seamless access and manipulation of data at various levels within the document hierarchy. By leveraging the power of combining nested documents and arrays, MongoDB empowers users to represent and work with intricate data structures efficiently and effectively.

By leveraging these techniques, you can effectively access and manipulate nested documents and arrays within MongoDB documents. This flexibility empowers you to work with diverse and intricate data structures, making MongoDB a powerful tool for managing complex data.

- Slide 16 -

MongoDB provides powerful update operators that allow you to modify existing documents in MongoDB collections efficiently. Here's an introduction to some commonly used update operators:

The $set operator is used to update specific fields within a document or add new fields if they are not already present. By using the updateOne() method, you can apply the $set operator to modify document fields. For instance, `db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $set: { field1: value1, field2: value2 } })` updates the "field1" and "field2" fields within a specific document. This operation ensures that the specified fields are modified with the provided values while leaving the rest of the document unaffected. 

The $unset operator is used to remove specific fields from a document. By utilizing the updateOne() method, you can apply the $unset operator to delete document fields. For instance, `db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $unset: { field1: "" } })` removes the "field1" field from a specific document. This operation ensures that the specified field is removed from the document, effectively eliminating its presence. 


The $inc operator in MongoDB is used to adjust the value of a numeric field by a specified amount, allowing for both incrementing and decrementing operations. For instance, using the updateOne() method, the query `db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $inc: { field1: 1 } })` increments the value of the "field1" field by 1 in a specific document. This operation modifies the value of the specified field within the document, either increasing or decreasing it by the given amount. The $inc operator is particularly useful when working with numeric data and provides a straightforward way to update values within MongoDB documents.

- Slide 17-

But wait, there is more. We also have the $push operatorer which allows for the addition of elements to an array field within a document. Using the updateOne() method, you can employ the $push operator to append elements to the specified array field. For instance, executing the query db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $push: { arrayField: element } }) adds the "element" to the "arrayField" within a specific document. This operation expands the array field by including the new element at the end. The $push operator is a convenient tool for updating arrays within MongoDB documents by appending elements.


The $pull operator in MongoDB enables the removal of elements from an array field based on a specified condition. By using the updateOne() method, you can apply the $pull operator to eliminate elements from the designated array field. For instance, executing the query `db.collectionName.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("documentId") }, { $pull: { arrayField: { condition } } })` removes elements from the "arrayField" that satisfy the specified "condition" within a specific document. This operation filters the array field and removes all matching elements, resulting in an updated array without those elements. The $pull operator provides a convenient way to selectively remove elements from an array field in MongoDB documents based on specific criteria.

These update operators provide flexibility and precision in modifying documents within MongoDB collections. By leveraging these operators, you can efficiently update specific fields, add or remove elements within arrays, and perform numeric operations on existing data. This allows for seamless and controlled modifications to your MongoDB data.

- Slide 18 - 

In MongoDB, removing documents from collections is achieved using the deleteOne() and deleteMany() methods. These methods offer a simple approach for removing documents based on specific criteria. The deleteOne() method removes a single document that matches the given filter, while the deleteMany() method removes multiple documents that meet the specified criteria. To use these methods, you provide a filter object as a parameter to identify the documents to be deleted. It is essential to carefully consider the accuracy of the filter criteria to avoid unintended data removal. Additionally, taking regular backups and considering data archiving can help ensure data safety and preservation. Proper management and cautious use of these deletion methods are crucial to maintain data integrity and avoid any unintended consequences.

## Creating new documents

The process of inserting new documents into MongoDB collections involves utilizing the `insertOne()` and `insertMany()` methods, which offer flexibility depending on the number of documents to be inserted.

To insert a single document, you can use the `insertOne()` method. This method takes a single document as an argument and adds it to the specified collection. For example:

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne({ field1: value1, field2: value2, ... });
```

On the other hand, when you need to insert multiple documents simultaneously, you can employ the `insertMany()` method. This method takes an array of documents as the parameter, and each document is inserted into the specified collection. For example:

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertMany([{ field1: value1, field2: value2 }, { field1: value3, field2: value4 }, ... ]);
```

Both `insertOne()` and `insertMany()` methods return information about the inserted documents, including the `_id` field, which is automatically generated by MongoDB to provide a unique identifier for each document.

By utilizing these methods, you can seamlessly insert new documents into MongoDB collections, ensuring efficient data storage and organization.

1. Basic Querying:
   - To retrieve documents from a collection, use the `find()` method without any parameters. This will return all documents in the collection.
   - For more specific queries, you can pass a filter object as an argument to the `find()` method. The filter object contains key-value pairs representing the fields and values to match against.
   - For example, to find documents where the value of the "name" field is "John", you would use: `db.collectionName.find({ name: "John" })`.

2. Comparison Operators:
   - MongoDB provides various comparison operators that allow you to query based on specific conditions. Some commonly used comparison operators include `$eq` (equals), `$ne` (not equals), `$gt` (greater than), `$lt` (less than), `$gte` (greater than or equals), and `$lte` (less than or equals).
   - For example, to find documents where the "age" field is greater than 30, you would use: `db.collectionName.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })`.

3. Logical Operators:
   - MongoDB also supports logical operators, such as `$and`, `$or`, and `$not`, which allow you to combine multiple conditions in a query.
   - For example, to find documents where the "age" field is greater than 30 and the "gender" field is "male", you would use: `db.collectionName.find({ $and: [{ age: { $gt: 30 } }, { gender: "male" }] })`.

4. Array Operators:
   - MongoDB provides array operators like `$in`, `$nin`, `$all`, `$elemMatch`, and more for querying arrays.
   - For example, to find documents where the "tags" field contains either "mongodb" or "database", you would use: `db.collectionName.find({ tags: { $in: ["mongodb", "database"] } })`.

5. Projections:
   - By default, the `find()` method returns all fields of the matched documents. You can use the second parameter of the `find()` method to specify which fields to include or exclude in the result.
   - For example, to include only the "name" and "age" fields in the result, you would use: `db.collectionName.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })`.

By using these querying techniques and operators, you can effectively filter and search for specific data in MongoDB collections, retrieving the desired documents based on your criteria.
