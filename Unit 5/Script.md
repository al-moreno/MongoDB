- Slide 1-
Welcome back. We'll start on what is to be our last module for your MongoDB course completion.

- Slide 2 - 
In this final lesson, we will explore MongoDB's powerful features for effective data manipulation and analysis. We'll cover operators, complex queries, and the usage of `$in` and `$nin` operators to query arrays efficiently. Then, we'll dive into the Aggregation Framework, mastering pipeline stages, aggregation operators, and group by operations. These techniques will enable you to transform and extract valuable insights from your data. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of querying and aggregation capabilities, permitting you to work with complex data sets and unleash MongoDB's full potential for your projects. 


 - Slide 3 - 

Logical operators play a crucial role in constructing complex queries to precisely retrieve the data you need. Although we have seen a bit of this in action already, we'll be exploring how we use logical operators such as `$and`, `$or`, `$not`, and `$nor` to refine our queries and obtain more specific results.

To construct queries with multiple conditions, the `$and` operator proves useful, requiring all conditions to be true for the document to be included in the result. 


The `$or` operator enables you to fetch documents that satisfy at least one of the given conditions. Like the `$and` operator, you can utilize an array to define multiple conditions within the `$or` operator.

The `$not` operator executes a logical negation on a provided condition. It facilitates the retrieval of documents that do not correspond to the specified condition.


The `$nor` operator in MongoDB functions similarly to `$or`, but it fetches documents that do not meet any of the specified conditions. It also accepts an array of conditions within the $nor operator.

By utilizing these logical operators, you can construct complex queries, combining multiple conditions and achieving precise data retrieval as we will see on the walthrough. 


- Slide 4 -

The `$in` and `$nin` operators in MongoDB are valuable tools that enable efficient filtering and querying of arrays based on multiple values. 

With the `$in` operator, you can retrieve documents where a specific field matches any value within a provided array.  

On the other hand, the `$nin` operator allows you to fetch documents where a field does not match any value within a given array. 

Utilizing these operators provides an efficient and effective way to filter and query arrays in MongoDB, allowing for precise data retrieval based on multiple values.


- Slide 5 - 

The Aggregation Framework enables advanced data processing and analysis tasks, including grouping, filtering, and transforming data for valuable insights. 

The `$group` stage is used to group documents based on specific fields or expressions, allowing you to perform aggregations and calculations within each group. 


The `$match` stage allows you to filter data by selecting documents that meet specific criteria. 


The `$project` stage transforms data by selecting specific fields and renaming them. This allows you to reshape the data and extract relevant information for analysis, which simplifies the data structure and enhances analysis capabilities.

The Aggregation Framework empowers advanced data processing and analysis. It offers versatile stages and operators for grouping, filtering, and transforming data, enabling valuable insights from the collections. 

- Slide 6 -

Previously I stated that the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB provides a powerful solution for data manipulation and analysis. It operates through a series of pipeline stages that process and transform data sequentially, allowing for controlled and efficient operations. These stages, such as `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$project`, and `$limit`, enable filtering, grouping, sorting, and limiting data based on specific criteria. Aggregation operators, including `$sum`, `$avg`, `$max`, `$min`, `$push`, `$addToSet`, `$project`, `$match`, and `$group`, are utilized within pipeline stages to perform calculations, transformations, and aggregations on the data. They empower users to extract valuable insights and conduct complex analysis. The `$group` stage is especially useful for performing group by operations, enabling grouping based on specific fields or expressions and performing aggregations within each group.

The example dipslayed on your screen currently demonstrates these concepts by filtering sales data within a date range, grouping it by category, calculating total sales using the $sum operator, sorting the results, and limiting the output to the top 5 categories. 

By leveraging the Aggregation Framework, users can effectively manipulate and analyze data, uncovering meaningful insights and performing sophisticated calculations with ease.


## Working with operators and complex queries


I stated that logical operators play a crucial role in constructing complex queries, lets now see how we can implement the logical operators were were introduced to in this walthough.


1. Use $and Operator:
   - Retrieve books where both conditions are met

```javascript
db.books.find({
  $and: [
    { author: "Colleen Hoover" },
    { pages: 460 }
  ]
});
```

2. Use $or Operator:
   - Retrieve books by one condition or the other
   
```javascript
db.books.find({
  $or: [
    { author:"Scarlett St. Clair" },
    { pages: { $gt: 500 } }
  ]
});
```

3. Use $not Operator:
   - Retrieve books that where the condition is not met

```javascript
db.books.find({
  author: { $not: { $eq: "Frank Herbert" } }
});
```

4. Use $nor Operator:
   - Retrieve books where neither condition is met

```javascript
db.books.find({
  $nor: [
    { author: "Scarlett St. Clair" },
    { rating: 9}
  ]
});
```


Having now played around a bit with advanced logical operators, we can confidently say we have understood how to implement them to obtain precise data. 



## Using $in and $nin operators for querying arrays


Next we'll explore the `$in` and `$nin` operators as we do some array quering and filtering. 


1. Use $in Operator:
   - Retrieve books that match one or the other value.

```javascript
db.books.find({ genres: { $in: ["Novel", "Historical Fiction"] } });
```

2. Use $nin Operator:
   - Retrieve books where the condition does not match

```javascript
db.books.find({ genres: { $nin: ["Romance novel", "Sci-fi"] } });
```



## Aggregation framework for advanced data processing and analysis


Next, we'll be practicing the use of the aggregation framework on the "books" collection so that we can perform some advanced data processing tasks. 


1. 2. Aggregation Operators:
   - Calculate the average rating for all books.

```javascript
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      averageRating: { $avg: "$rating" }
    }
  }
])
```

2. Grouping and Aggregation:
   - Calculate the average rating for books in each genre.

```javascript
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$genres",
      averageRating: { $avg: "$rating" }
    }
  }
])
```

1. Pipeline Stages:
   - Retrieve all books with a rating greater than 4.5.

```javascript
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      rating: { $gt: 4.5 }
    }
  }
])
```

3. Group by Operations:
   - Group books by genres and calculate the average rating for each genre.

```javascript
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$genres",
      averageRating: { $avg: "$rating" }
    }
  }
])
```

2. Filtering and Projection:
   - Retrieve books with a rating greater than 4.5, including only the "title," "author," and "rating" fields.

```javascript
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      rating: { $gt: 4.5 }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      title: 1,
      author: 1,
      rating: 1
    }
  }
])
```

3. Sorting and Limiting:
   - Find the top 3 highest-rated books and sort them by rating in descending order.

```javascript
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $sort: {
      rating: 1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 3
  }
])
```
